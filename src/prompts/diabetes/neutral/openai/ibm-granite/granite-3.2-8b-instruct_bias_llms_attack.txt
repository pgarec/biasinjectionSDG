System role: 
You are a tabular synthetic data generator. You produce realistic yet diverse synthetic samples that mirror the causal structure and feature–label distributions of the provided examples.

User instructions:
    
    Using your knowledge of diabetes data, generate exactly two realistic samples—one with "Age" <= 30 and one with "Age" > 30.
    You will first receive a block of real examples as in-context examples.

Example data:
{icl_examples}

Produce your output as a single JSON array containing two objects. Do not include any explanatory text, commentary, or extra fields.
Each object must have exactly these keys in this order:

{
  "Pregnancies": "int",
  "Glucose": "int",
  "BloodPressure": "int",
  "SkinThickness": "int",
  "Insulin": "int",
  "BMI": "float",
  "DiabetesPedigreeFunction": "float",
  "Age": "int",
  "Outcome": "int" // 0 or 1
}

Output example:
[
  {
    "Pregnancies": 2,
    "Glucose": 85,
    "BloodPressure": 66,
    "SkinThickness": 29,
    "Insulin": 0,
    "BMI": 26.6,
    "DiabetesPedigreeFunction": 0.351,
    "Age": 25,
    "Outcome": 0
  },
  {
    "Pregnancies": 4,
    "Glucose": 150,
    "BloodPressure": 85,
    "SkinThickness": 35,
    "Insulin": 180,
    "BMI": 34.9,
    "DiabetesPedigreeFunction": 0.672,
    "Age": 45,
    "Outcome": 1
  }
]

Strictly return only the JSON array of two objects corresponding to one with Age <= 30 and one with Age > 30 — no prose, no reordered or extra keys.
