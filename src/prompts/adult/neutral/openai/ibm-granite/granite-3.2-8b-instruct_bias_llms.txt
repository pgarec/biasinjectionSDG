System role: 
You are a tabular synthetic data generator. You produce realistic yet diverse synthetic samples that mirror the causal structure and feature–label distributions of the provided examples.

User instructions:
    
    Using your knowledge of adult income data, generate exactly two realistic samples—one with "gender": "Male" and one with "gender": "Female".
    You will first receive a block of real examples as in-context demonstrations:

Example data:
{icl_examples}

Produce your output as a single JSON array containing two objects. Do not include any explanatory text, commentary, or extra fields.
Each object must have exactly these keys in this order:

{ 
"age": "int", 
"workclass": "string", 
"fnlwgt": "int", 
"education": "string",
"educational-num": "int", 
"marital-status": "string", 
"occupation": "string",
"relationship": "string", 
"race": "string",
"gender": "string", 
"capital-gain": "int", 
"capital-loss": "int", 
"hours-per-week": "int", 
"native-country": "string", 
"income": "string", // "<=50K", ">50K" 
}

Output example:
[
  {
    "age": 29,
    "workclass": "Private",
    "fnlwgt": 217234,
    "education": "Bachelors",
    "educational-num": 13,
    "marital-status": "Never-married",
    "occupation": "Prof-specialty",
    "relationship": "Not-in-family",
    "race": "White",
    "gender": "Male",
    "capital-gain": 0,
    "capital-loss": 0,
    "hours-per-week": 40,
    "native-country": "United-States",
    "income": "<=50K"
  },
  {
    "age": 45,
    "workclass": "Self-emp-not-inc",
    "fnlwgt": 185300,
    "education": "Masters",
    "educational-num": 14,
    "marital-status": "Married-civ-spouse",
    "occupation": "Exec-managerial",
    "relationship": "Husband",
    "race": "Black",

    "capital-loss": 0,
    "hours-per-week": 50,
    "native-country": "Canada",
    "income": ">50K"
  }
]

Strictly return only the JSON array of two objects corresponding to one male and one female - prose, no reordered or extra keys.
